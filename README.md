Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is a systematic and comprehensive approach that conducts a risk assessment of a
variety of potential outcomes.

The OpenPRA program aims to provide a unique platform that integrates multiple PRA methods and tools into a holistic, easy-
to-use, and highly customizable framework.

By participating in NCSU GEARS program, I solved the issues in the development of the software OpenPRA Web-Editor. My job
focus more on the frontend development, and center on the event sequence diagram visualization. This repo contains my final academic poster and presentation video.
